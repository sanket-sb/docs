The **Order entity** serves as the foundational record that captures detailed information about the line items purchased by a customer. Each line item within an order represents a product eligible for various warranty offerings, such as:

- Product protection plans
- Shipping warranties

The **SureBright Order API** is designed to transmit sold contract details to our system and to manage related operations such as order updates and cancellations. It acts as the primary interface for creating, updating, or canceling warranty contracts associated with your sales.

## üîß Key Functions of the Order API

### ‚úÖ Create Warranty Contracts

When a new order is submitted:

- The API checks if the `partnerOrderId` exists in SureBright‚Äôs records.
- If it **does not exist**, the API automatically generates **warranty contracts** for the order‚Äôs line items based on the provided details.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Update Existing Contracts

When the `partnerOrderId` **already exists**:

- Use the **`PUT method`** to update the existing order and its associated warranty contracts.
- If a lower quantity is specified for any line item compared to the original order, the system will **automatically cancel** the corresponding number of warranty contracts to reflect the reduced coverage.

### ‚ùå Cancel Specific Line Items

To cancel warranty coverage on a particular product line:

- Set the `warrantyQuantity` field to `0` for that line item in the `lineItemList` via the `PUT` method.
- This action cancels **only** the warranty contracts for that specific line item, leaving the rest of the order unaffected.
