A **Product Category** represents the classification of products into SureBright categories based on product attributes such as title, description, and price.

This classification enables stores to:
- Automatically categorize products for warranty eligibility
- Determine appropriate warranty coverage based on product type

## How Product Categorization Works

The categorization process analyzes:
- **Product Title** – The name or title of the product
- **Product Description** – Additional details about the product
- **Product Price** – The price of the product

Based on these attributes, the system returns:
- **SB Category ID** – Unique identifier for the SureBright category
- **Category Name** – The assigned category name
- **SB Category Name** – The SureBright category classification
