## Overview

This guide explains the two key events SureBright sends to Klaviyo to power your warranty-related marketing flows. Order data from your e-commerce platform is used to determine eligibility, and to generate unique links for eligible end customers receiving the post purchase email. These events enable you to create targeted post-purchase communications for customers with warranty-eligible products and those who have purchased warranties.

## Configure the Integration

Share your[ Klaviyo Public Key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267#your-public-api-key-site-id2) with the SureBright Team.

If you want SureBright to handle Warranty related marketing flows and templates then share a Private Key with the SureBright Team by following[ the guide](https://app.storylane.io/share/gmb05pqr5zbj).

## Klaviyo Set-up & Defining the Flows

Navigate to the Klaviyo page that allows you to define the[<u>Klaviyo flow</u>](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932-Getting-Started-with-Flows)  with the initial trigger and filters.

To define the [[<u>Post-Purchase Flow</u>](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932-Getting-Started-with-Flows)] , focus on these Klaviyo fields:

Trigger - Set to **SureBright: Eligible Order**. Do not use the generic **Placed Order**.\
Trigger Filter - Set to **"is_eligible: true"**.

Use the SureBright-integrated attributes to insert the event data in the communication template. The key attribute to be used is **post_purchase_url**, which takes the user to a customer-facing page where protection plans can be directly purchased.

## Event - SureBright: Eligible Order

This event is triggered when a customer purchases a product that is eligible for a SureBright warranty. Here are the attributes available to you in Klaviyo about SureBright eligibility on your store's orders:
