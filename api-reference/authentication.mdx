## Overview

The SureBright API uses a private API key for authenticating requests. This key must be included in the request header using the X-SureBright-Access-Token field. You can view and manage your API key through the SureBright Merchant Portal under Account Settings.

🔒 **Important:**
Your API key grants privileged access—treat it as sensitive information. Never expose your API key in public repositories (e.g., GitHub) or embed it in client-side code.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Requests sent over plain HTTP will be rejected. Proper authentication is required for all interactions with the SureBright API.
