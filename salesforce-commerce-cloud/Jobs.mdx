## SureBright Products Export

This job uses SureBright's API to traverse the entire storefront catalog and export each Simple and Variant Product that is, at the time of the job run, merchandisable (online and in stock).

### Configuration Steps

1. Go to Business Manager **→** Administration **→** Operations **→** Jobs. Select the **SureBright Products Export** job.
2. Go to Job Steps and select **Scope**. Configure this to run in the scope of the site integrating with SureBright.
3. Ensure this job is triggered at least once without errors and notify SureBright after the successful run. SureBright will confirm if the product sync was successful.
4. Schedule this to run at the preferred cadence (SureBright recommends once per day), at a time that's most suitable for a recurring job setup, ideally after the catalog is being updated.
