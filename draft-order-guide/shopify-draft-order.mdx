description: "This document describes how to use Shopify’s Draft Orders to record over the phone sales"
---

A Draft Order in Shopify allows merchants to manually create orders for custom or over the phone sales outside the regular checkout process. It benefits merchants by providing personalized orders, flexible payment options, and the ability to review an invoice before payment. Draft orders reserve inventory, enabling quick adjustments like adding items or modifying quantities. They also allow for special discounts and act as quotations, offering transparency in pricing.

## Sales Use Cases/ Scenarios

We have listed the common scenarios/use cases below. Please feel free to directly jump to the scenario which is applicable to you.
