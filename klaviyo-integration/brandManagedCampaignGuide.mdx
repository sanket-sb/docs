  **Disclaimer:** Access credentials must be shared and initial configuration steps completed as outlined in the [Klaviyo Integration Guide](/klaviyo-integration/klaviyoIntegrationGuide). Once setup is complete, you may proceed with this guide.

### Seamless Klaviyo Integration

To power these campaigns, we push the following data directly to Klaviyo:

- Warranty plan details
- Order and product information
- Coverage summary
- Personalized post-purchase journey links

This enables you to craft dynamic, timely, and relevant messages to drive conversions and enhance customer trust.

### 1. Navigate to the Flow Builder

- Log in to your Klaviyo account.
- Go to **Flows** from the left-hand menu.
- Click [**Create Flow**](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932-Getting-Started-with-Flows).
- Choose **Build your own**, and name your flow something like `SureBright Post-Purchase Warranty`.

---

### 2. Set the Trigger

- For the **Trigger**, select **Metric**.
- In the dropdown, \*\*choose \*\*`SureBright: Eligible Order`.

> ⚠️ _Do not use the generic “Placed Order” trigger—this will not capture warranty-eligible events._

---

### 3. Add a Trigger Filter

- After selecting the trigger, click **“Trigger Filters”**.
- Add a condition:
  - **Field:** `is_eligible`
  - **Condition:** `equals`
  - **Value:** `true`

> ✅ This ensures that only orders eligible for a post-purchase warranty offer are included.

---

### 4. Build Your Flow

- Add your **email step(s)** to the flow as desired.
- Use **SureBright event data** to personalize your messaging.

---

### 5. Personalize Using Event Attributes

In your email content, you can dynamically insert values from the SureBright event payload. One key attribute to include is:

- `{{ event.post_purchase_url }}` – This is a unique, customer-facing link where protection plans can be directly purchased.

You can also use additional attributes like:

- `{{ event.order_id }}`
- `{{ event.product_title }}`
- `{{ event.coverage_options }}`
- `{{ event.first_name }}`

---

### 6. Submit for Review

Before activating the flow, please submit a preview or test email to the SureBright team for compliance review and approval.

### SureBright: Eligible Order

Use this event to drive engagement and conversion among customers who didn’t buy a warranty at checkout:

- **Follow-up Campaigns:** Send reminder emails prompting customers to purchase protection for eligible products.
- **Timed Drip Flows:** Create flows that trigger based on time elapsed since purchase, nudging non-buyers at key intervals.
- **Direct to Purchase:** Use the `post_purchase_url` to guide customers to a pre-filled, personalized warranty offer page.

### SureBright: Policy Purchased

Leverage this event to build customer trust and extend your brand experience post-purchase:

- **Acknowledge and Appreciate Your Customers:** Brand's customized thank-you message.
- **Stop further communications:** Scheduled communications can be terminated based on this event.

## Best Practices

Ensure your campaign delivers maximum value and conversion by following these recommendations:

- **Dynamic Personalization:** Use attributes like `product_title`, `coverage_type`, and `policy_price` to tailor messaging.
- **Contextual Journeys:** Differentiate your flows based on warranty type—e.g., breakdown vs. accidental damage—to increase relevance.

### FAQs

<Accordion title="Can I send post-purchase emails to all of my previous customers?" iconType="duotone">
  Data from SureBright begins flowing into Klaviyo only after the integration is enabled. This means that any historical SureBright data—captured prior to activation—will not be available within Klaviyo.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I see the SureBright metric or data in Klaviyo to be used in creating a flow?" iconType="duotone">
  Once SureBright has completed the configuration on your account, the relevant events (e.g., SureBright: Eligible Order, SureBright: Policy Purchased) and associated data will appear in Klaviyo. If you've already shared access but still don't see the events, please wait for confirmation from the SureBright team or contact support for an update.
