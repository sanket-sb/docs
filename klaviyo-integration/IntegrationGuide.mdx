### Program Options

We offer two flexible modes to support your campaign:

1. **White-Glove Campaign Management (Recommended)**\
   Our team will handle everything—from setup to execution—for all eligible customers. This is the most hands-off option and ensures high-performing campaigns aligned with best practices.
2. [**Brand-Managed Campaigns**](/klaviyo-integration/brandManagedCampaignGuide)\
   For brands that prefer to control their customer experience, we enable you to use your own email templates and messaging. SureBright provides the necessary data; you bring the creative.

> **Note:** All post-purchase emails must be approved by the SureBright team to ensure brand and compliance alignment.
