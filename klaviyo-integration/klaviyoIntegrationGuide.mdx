### Program Options

We offer two flexible modes to support your campaign:

1. **White-Glove Campaign Management (Recommended)**\
   Our team will handle everything—from setup to execution—for all eligible customers. This is the most hands-off option and ensures high-performing campaigns aligned with best practices.
2. [**Brand-Managed Campaigns**](/klaviyo-integration/brandManagedCampaignGuide)\
   For brands that prefer to control their customer experience, we enable you to use your own email templates and messaging. SureBright provides the necessary data; you bring the creative.

> **Note:** All post-purchase emails must be approved by the SureBright team to ensure brand and compliance alignment.

### Seamless Klaviyo Integration

To power these campaigns, we push the following data directly to your Klaviyo account:

- Warranty plan details
- Order and product information
- Coverage summary
- Personalized post-purchase journey links

This enables you to craft dynamic, timely, and relevant messages to drive conversions and enhance customer trust.

## Installation

We need access to a public key and a private key for enabling the program for you. Here are the steps to help you share the access.

1. Sharing [Klaviyo Public Key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267#your-public-api-key-site-id2)
2. Sharing Klaviyo private key using [guide](https://app.storylane.io/share/gmb05pqr5zbj).

## Implementation Use Cases

### **SureBright: Eligible Order**

Use this event to drive engagement and conversion among customers who didn’t buy a warranty at checkout:

- **Follow-up Campaigns:** Send reminder emails prompting customers to purchase protection for eligible products.
- **Timed Drip Flows:** Create flows that trigger based on time elapsed since purchase, nudging non-buyers at key intervals.
- **Direct to Purchase:** Use the `post_purchase_url` to guide customers to a pre-filled, personalized warranty offer page.

### **SureBright: Policy Purchased**

Leverage this event to build customer trust and extend your brand experience post-purchase:

- **Confirmation Emails:** Immediately send policy confirmation and a thank-you message.
- **Educational Content:** Follow up with information on how to access and use their warranty.

## Best Practices

Ensure your campaign delivers maximum value and conversion by following these recommendations:

- **Dynamic Personalization:** Use attributes like `product_title`, `coverage_type`, and `policy_price` to tailor messaging.
- **Contextual Journeys:** Differentiate your flows based on warranty type—e.g., breakdown vs. accidental damage—to increase relevance.
