## Seamless Integration

To power these campaigns, SureBright automatically sends enriched customer and order data to your Klaviyo account once you have shared access as mentioned in <Tooltip tip="Link to Klaviyo Integration guide">integration guide</Tooltip>. This includes:

- Warranty plan details
- Order and product information
- Coverage summary
- Personalized post-purchase journey links

This enables you to craft dynamic, timely, and relevant messages to drive conversions and enhance customer trust.

## Flow Configuration

### Overview

To engage customers with eligible warranty options, you'll set up a custom flow in Klaviyo based on SureBright's eligibility events. This involves:

- Creating a new flow tailored for warranty outreach.
- Selecting the specific **SureBright: Eligible Order** event as the trigger.
- Filtering the trigger to target only eligible orders.
- Designing email steps that leverage SureBright Event data for personalized messaging.
- Inserting dynamic links and details from the events to enhance relevance.
- Test the functionality end-to-end by creating an order with SureBright Warranty Eligible product.

  <Note>
    All post-purchase emails must be approved by the SureBright team to ensure brand and compliance alignment.
  </Note>

### 1. Navigate to the Flow Builder

- Log in to your Klaviyo account.
- Go to **Flows** from the left-hand menu.
- Click [**Create Flow**](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932-Getting-Started-with-Flows).
- Choose **Build your own**, and name your flow something like `SureBright Post-Purchase Warranty`.

---

### 2. Set the Trigger

- For the **Trigger**, select **Metric**.
- In the dropdown, \*\*choose \*\*`SureBright: Eligible Order`.

<Warning>
  _Do not use the generic "Placed Order" trigger—this will not capture warranty-eligible events._
</Warning>

---

### 3. Add a Trigger Filter

- After selecting the trigger, click **"Trigger Filters"**.
- Add a condition:
  - **Field:** `is_eligible`
  - **Condition:** `equals`
  - **Value:** `true`

<Check>
  This ensures that only orders eligible for a post-purchase warranty offer are included.
</Check>

**4. Build Your Flow**

- Add your **email step(s)** to the flow as desired.
- Use **SureBright event data** to personalize your messaging.

### 5. Personalize Using Event Attributes

In your email content, you can dynamically insert values from the SureBright event payload. One key attribute to include is:

- `{{ event.post_purchase_url }}` – This is a unique, customer-facing link where protection plans can be directly purchased.

You can also use additional attributes like:

- `{{ event.order_id }}`
- `{{ event.product_title }}`
- `{{ event.coverage_options }}`
- `{{ event.person.first_name }}`

### 6. Submit for Review

Before activating the flow, please submit a preview or test email to the SureBright team for compliance review and approval.

## Best Practices

Ensure your campaign delivers maximum value and conversion by following these recommendations:

- **Contextual Journeys:** Differentiate your flows based on warranty type—e.g., breakdown vs. accidental damage—to increase relevance.

### FAQs

<Accordion title="Can I send post-purchase emails to all of my previous customers?" iconType="duotone">
  Event Data from SureBright begins flowing into Klaviyo only after the integration is enabled. This means that any historical SureBright Data—captured prior to activation—will not be available within Klaviyo.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I see the SureBright metric or data in Klaviyo to be used in creating a flow?" iconType="duotone">
  Once SureBright has completed the configuration on your account, the relevant events (e.g., SureBright: Eligible Order, SureBright: Policy Purchased) and associated data will appear in Klaviyo. If you've already shared access but still don't see the events, please wait for confirmation from the SureBright team or contact support for an update.
